<h2> Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs </h2>
I adapted this recipe from a book called <i> Sydney Food </i> by 
Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1 <sup> st </sup>
visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney, I have been after the 
recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the 
<i> best </i> scrambled	eggs I have ever tasted.
<br/>
This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast"; just look at the
ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<b> The following ingredients make one serving: </b>
<ul>
<li> 2 eggs </li>
<li> 1 tablespoon of butter(10g) </li>
<li> 1/3 cup of cream(2 3/4 fl ounces) </li>
<li> A pinch of salt </li>
<li> Freshly milled black pepper </li>
<li> 3 fresh chives(Chopped) </li>
</ul>
<h2> Instructions </h2>
<ol>
<li> Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl. </li>
<li> Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat(taking
care not to burn the butter). </li>
<li> Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting
around the edge of the pan(Around 20 seconds). </li>
<li> Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center
as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.
</li>
<li> Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until
the eggs are only just done. </li>
<li> Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the 
eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives. </li>
</ol>
You should only make a <b> maximum </b> of two servings per frying pan.
